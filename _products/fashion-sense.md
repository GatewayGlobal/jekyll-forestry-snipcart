  She gazed into my soul; her eyes of liquid amber scrutinizing things inside of which I could only dream of seeing in myself. She was a mystery. A dangerously beautiful mystery, and I was ensnared in the trap which she'd set.

  The moon poured down on us, showering us with beams of light. They caught in her hair, these moonbeams, making each dark curl seem as though it was alight with passion. Her skin was illuminated by the stars; she looked deathly pale, like her heart would stop any moment, but I knew the truth. That it was beating away inside her, like a constant drum. Longingly, I devoured her face with my eyes, wishing with all my being that I could reach out and brush my hand against her perfectly shaped cheekbones, or under the feathers of her thick, dark lashes. But I refrained from doing so, and continued to succumb to the endless torture of watching her without being able to touch. She was like a china ornament, and it seemed that even the gentlest caress would break her delicate form. Her breath toppled out of her soft lips like a ball of tumble weed softly blowing through the sky. She was a fallen angel; a princess of darkness; a twilight queen. She was a mystery. A dangerously beautiful mystery. And I was in love with her.

title: Swimming Lessons
description: I could swim forever, dive forever, be here in this underwater world
  forever. There is something about the motion of it that becomes natural after a
  while. I'll always need the air and the sunlight, to feel the saline water wash
  over my skin and through my eye lashes, but there's a reason I was sent here. And
  so, I swim while I can, rescue while I'm strong, rest when I must. There are times
  I want to be saved, to give up and await strong arms to pull me from this struggle,
  then I remember who I am and keep going. I am the rescuer, the swimmer.

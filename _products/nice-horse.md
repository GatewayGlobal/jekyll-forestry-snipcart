title: Nice Horse
description: She is my pride and joy. With soft eyes that you could stare into forever,
  falling, but at the same time so still, they reflected promise. A heart made of
  love, slender profile, and a gorgeous chestnut coat, Juliette was always there for
  me in the darkest days, when it felt like my life was a hurricane in an endless
  sea. I will never forget the days I spent with her, cantering in a field full of
  daisies, under a clear blue sky.

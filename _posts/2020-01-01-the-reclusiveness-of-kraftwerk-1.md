The band is notoriously reclusive, providing rare and enigmatic interviews, using life-size mannequins and robots to conduct official photo shoots, refusing to accept mail and not allowing visitors at the [Kling Klang Studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kling_Klang_Studio "Kling Klang Studio"), the precise location of which they used to keep secret.

Another notable example of this eccentric behaviour was reported to [Johnny Marr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Marr "Johnny Marr") of [the Smiths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smiths "The Smiths") by Karl Bartos, who explained that anyone trying to contact the band for collaboration would be told the studio telephone did not have a ringer since while recording, the band did not like to hear any kind of noise pollution. Instead, callers were instructed to phone the studio precisely at a certain time, whereupon the phone would be answered by Ralf HÃ¼tter, despite never hearing the phone ring.

[Chris Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Martin "Chris Martin") of [Coldplay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coldplay "Coldplay") recalled in a 2007 article in [_Q_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(magazine) "Q (magazine)") magazine the process of requesting permission to use the melody from the track "Computer Love" on "Talk" from the album [_X&Y_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X%26Y "X&Y"). He sent a letter through the lawyers of the respective parties and several weeks later received an envelope containing a handwritten reply that simply said "yes".
